This program implements two main menus to handle circular queue’s and Linked Lists using queues.
Upon starting the program, the user will be asked to enter the size of the circular Queue. The value entered must be a numeric number.
After entering the size of the circular queue, the user will be presented with a menu consisting of 9 commands involving the circular Queue and 1 exit command which closes the menu loop and moves on to the next menu.
Here is what each command will do:
1: Returns a true or false value about whether the CQ is full.
2: Returns a true or false value about whether the CQ is empty.
3: Will print the value at the front of the Queue. If the Queue is empty it will return -1
4: Will print the value at the rear of the Queue. If the Queue is empty it will return -1
5: User will be asked to enter a value that will then be inserted into the front of the Queue. Should the queue be full, it will print a message letting the user know that it is full.
6: User will be asked to enter a value that will then be inserted into the rear of the Queue. Should the queue be full, it will print a message letting the user know that it is full.
7: Deletes the first value in the queue. Should the queue be empty, it will print a message letting the user know it is empty.
8: Deletes the last value in the queue. Should the queue be empty, it will print a message letting the user know it is empty.
9: Will print out the entire queue from left to right starting at front and ending at the rear.
0: Prints a farewell message and exits the CQ menu.

After the user exits the CQ menu, they will enter the Linked List menu.
The user will be presented with a menu consisting of 10 commands to modify 2 Linked Lists and 1 exit command.
Here is what each command will do:
1: Enqueue’s a user entered value into List 1 (values must be entered in ascending order!)
2: Enqueue’s a user entered value into List 2 (values must be entered in ascending order!)
3: Returns the length (how many elements) of both lists
4: Will return a true/false value if either list is empty
5: Dequeu’s (removes) the head of List 1. If the List is empty, will print a message letting the user know then returns to the loop for next input.
6: Dequeu’s (removes) the head of List 2. If the List is empty, will print a message letting the user know then returns to the loop for next input.
7: Returns the first (head) elements in both lists. If the list is empty, will print a message letting the user know.
8: Searches both lists for a user entered number. If the list contains it, returns true. Else it returns false.
9: Will print both lists
10: Merges the two lists into a single list, then prints it. (List 1 and 2 still exist. The merged list is a separate entity)
0: Exits the menu loop.

After exiting the second menu loop, the program will end.
